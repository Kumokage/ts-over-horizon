# Prediction over horizon
Here you can find implementation of the algorithm for [predictions over the predictability horizon](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350095266_Chaotic_Time_Series_Prediction_Run_for_the_Horizon) using the [algorithm of long-term missing value imputation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-022-08165-6). We plan to test the resulting implementation on data from the [Optiver - Trading at the Close competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close) or on other public time series data.
